## About Myself:
My hobby was developing games on the CryEngine 3 engine. I mastered 3ds Max, Photoshop, XML, ActionScript, Lua at a basic level.
The first programming language that I consciously began to learn was C. I created several simple programs on it, after which I completely switched to learning JavaScript and creating websites.
After studying the frontend, I finally made my choice. I want to change my field of activity and do what I love.

## My skills:
* Markdown
* HTML (bootstrap, pug)
* CSS (less, sass)
* JavaScript
* Git, GitHub
* Figma, Photoshop

## Code Example:
```
function group(array, keySelector, valueSelector) {
  return array.reduce((map, item) => {
    const keyS = keySelector(item);
    const valueS = valueSelector(item);
    if (!map.has(keyS)) map.set(keyS, []);
    map.get(keyS).push(valueS);
    return map;
  }, new Map());
}
```
