##### About Myself:
My hobby was developing games on the CryEngine 3 engine. Then I mastered 3ds Max, Photoshop, XML, ActionScript, Lua at a basic level.
I liked writing scripts and got into programming. The first programming language that was consciously taught was C.
After that, I decided on a further direction and began to study FrontEnd.

##### Skills:
* HTML (pug)
* CSS (less, sass)
* JS
* Git
* Figma
* Photoshop

##### Code Example:
```
function colculateStackingCount(stackMaxCount, cargoHeight, stackHeight){
  if (stackMaxCount != "") return stackMaxCount;
  if (stackMaxCount == "") {
    let stackHeight = Number(cargoHeight);
    for( let counter = 0; stackHeight < stackHeight; counter++ ){
      stackHeight += Number(cargoHeight);
    }
    return counter;
  } else return 1;
}
```
